3-page website for the "Tiny Leaf" tea house.

![Project preview screens](./preview_3%20screens.png)

The aims of this project are:

- To build something beautiful and really show off your CSS skills and your eye for detail - essential front-end dev skills!
- Work with professional design files in Figma, with designs in 3 sizes and a style guide to help you set up your project
- To make it fully responsive, and to write semantic and accessible HTML
- To practise capturing user information from a booking form (something youâ€™ll do all the time as a FE developer!)
- Continue getting comfortable working with Git and making Pull Requests
- Bonus: Practice working in an Agile way by creating your own Kanban board of tasks, estimating your tickets and planning your Sprints

## How to get your code reviewed

You can get your code reviewed by a CodeCaravan mentor and experienced developer. This will be done by opening a Pull Request on Github, which your reviewer will comment on.

In order for this to be possible, you'll need to follow a few simple steps:

Before you start working on this project, make sure you **fork this repository first**

This will ensure your personal version of TINY LEAF is connected to CodeCaravan's - making it possible to open Pull Requests pointing to CodeCaravan on Github, which will enable CodeCaravan mentors to review your code if you request it.

**Follow these steps:**

- **Fork this repo:** this will create a copy of it on your own Github account
- **Then clone** this new personal version of the repo (you should now be on github.com/yourgithubusername/TINY-LEAF, where 'yourgithubusername' is your Github username)
- **Start working** and committing code. If you're not sure you've done it right, test it with one simple change at first. Add 1-2 lines of code, commit and push, and then check that github.com/yourgithubusername/TINY-LEAF reflects the change
- When you're ready, **open a Pull Request** from your repo pointing to CodeCaravan's version

If you have any trouble or questions, feel free to ask in the [#code-reviews channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/BdeBF5vz).
