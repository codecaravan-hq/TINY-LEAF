The aims of this project are:

- To build something beautiful and really show off your CSS skills and your eye for detail - essential front-end dev skills!
- Work with professional design files in Figma, with designs in 3 sizes and a style guide to help you set up your project
- To make it fully responsive, and to write semantic and accessible HTML
- To practise capturing user information from a booking form (something youâ€™ll do all the time as a FE developer!)
- Continue getting comfortable working with Git and making Pull Requests
- Learn to work in an Agile way by creating your own Kanban board of tasks, estimating your tickets and planning your Sprints
